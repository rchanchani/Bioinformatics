# HIV Structural Bioinformatics

## Splitting up PDB files into proteins and ligands

We will first download and read in the 1hsg protein from PDB.
```{r read, warning=FALSE}
library(bio3d)
prot <- get.pdb("1hsg")
```

Then, we will read in the strucutre of the protein and the ligand bound to it, and split up
these two components into separate files to attempt docking of ligands into the protein. This is done after removing the water molecules in the structure.
```{r}
hiv <- read.pdb(prot)
prot <- trim.pdb(hiv, "protein")
lig <-trim.pdb(hiv, "ligand")
write.pdb(prot, file="1hsg_protein.pdb")
write.pdb(lig, file="1hsg_ligand.pdb")
```

## Docking with Vina

We run this command: `~/Downloads/autodock_vina_1_1_2_mac/bin/vina --config config.txt --log log.txt`
This extracts the docking results and saves the orientations as PDBs.
```{r}
res <- read.pdb("all.pdbqt", multi=TRUE)
write.pdb(res, "results.pdb")
```

To assess the results quantitatively we will calculate the RMSD (root mean square distance)
between each of the docking results and the known crystal structure using the bio3d package. Read the original ligand with added hydrogens that you produced earlier and use the rmsd() function to compare to the docking results.
```{r echo=TRUE}
#res <- read.pdb("all.pdbqt", multi=TRUE)
ori <- read.pdb("1hsg_ligand.pdbqt")
rmsd(ori, res)
```
We see that the RMSD values do not always correspond to the energy affinity of the docking conformations.
The values left to right of RMSD output are in order of energy preference and in units of angstroms.

```{r}
res <- read.pdb("all.pdbqt", multi=TRUE)
write.pdb(res, "results.pdb")
```

## Normal Mode Analysis

Read in the hen egg white lysozome and perform Normal Mode Analysis.
```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1HEL")
modes <- nma(pdb)
plot(modes, sse=pdb)
```
Visualize the normal mode analysis results shown in the figure above.
```{r}
mktrj(modes, mode=7, file="nma_7.pdb")
```
